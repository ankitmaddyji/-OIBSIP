    <p>
      Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer,
      and physicist. He is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current
      (AC) electrical supply system.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, Austrian Empire (now Croatia). He immigrated to the United
      States in 1884 and worked with Thomas Edison for a brief period. However, Tesla's vision for an AC-based
      power transmission clashed with Edison's preference for direct current (DC) systems, leading to their
      famous rivalry known as the "War of Currents."
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of Tesla's notable inventions include the induction motor, Tesla coil, and wireless transmission
      of energy. His work laid the foundation for numerous modern technologies, including radio, radar,
      fluorescent lighting, and wireless communication.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite his many achievements, Tesla struggled financially throughout his life. He died on January 7, 1943,
      in New York City, but his contributions to science and technology continue to inspire generations.
